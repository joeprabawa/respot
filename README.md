> Summary 
 - Motivation behind building this is app is to helped Hard Rock FM Bali Music Director to organize and creating playlists that want to be played on Hard Rock FM's Bali Studio. Previously, all this time the music director work on the playlist still using Ms.Excel
 - Each 3 days, music director will make a curated playlist (searching/browse and listen to songs) and writed all of the songs details/meta on Ms.Excel, with the total amount of songs are 400. 
 - Because of the large amount of songs to be written manually, why don't we **build an app** that could create a playlist automatically. Since Spotify as a music streaming service, also provide a large scale API to interact with, i proposed to build an app that interact with the Spotify API.
- With this app, music director can make curated playlist on their spotify's account and this app will pulled their playlist and grab all of the meta/information about all the tracks.
